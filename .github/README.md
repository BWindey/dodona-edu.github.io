# Dodona documentation website

This website uses VitePress and serves the documentation in both English and Dutch. Therefore, it is important that the same directory structure is used within the `nl` and `en` subdirectories. Changes to the configuration can be made in `.vitepress/config.js`.

Pushing to `main` will automatically publish this website.

To test locally, run `yarn install` and `yarn dev`, to build, run `yarn build`.

## Fork
Working on some API documentation, primarily for myself, for the joy of peeking around. And of course it's handy to have something to look through when I'm searching for a certain feature.
