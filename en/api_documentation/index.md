# API Documentation

In this section you'll find info on how to use the API as a developer. If you are looking for how to create an API-token, you can read that at [FAQ/api-tokens](../faq/api-tokens).

::: warning
If you want to build an application, tool or plugin that uses the Dodona API, please contact us at [dodona@ugent.be](mailto:dodona@ugent.be) so we can help you out. This will also allow us to notify you if we make any changes to the API.
