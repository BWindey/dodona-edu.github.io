# FAQ: Featured courses

[[toc]]

## What is a featured course?

A 'Featured Course' on Dodona is a course that has been highlighted or recommended due to its educational content, quality or relevance to a particular topic or skill. Featured courses are curated and marked as such by Team Dodona.

The goal of featured courses is to help users navigate the wide range of courses available and identify those that may be particularly useful or well regarded. These courses are not created by Team Dodona.

## I made a course, how can I get it featured?

If you've created a course and would like to have it featured on Dodona, please contact Team Dodona through the [contact form](https://dodona.be/en/contact) or by sending an email to [dodona@ugent.be](mailto:dodona@ugent.be).

## How can I use a featured course?

As a student, you can use a featured course in the same way as any other course on Dodona. You can register for the course using the button at the top of the page and work through the material at your own pace. You can also submit solutions to the programming exercises and get instant feedback on your work.

As a teacher, we recommend that you make a copy of the featured course and use it as a starting point for your own course. This way, you can adjust the learning path of the course, set deadlines, monitor the progress of students, organize tests and exams, review submitted solutions, and appoint colleagues as fellow course administrators.
