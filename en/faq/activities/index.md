# FAQ: Exercises and reading activities

## What is a draft activity? <Badge type="tip" text="teacher" />
A draft is an exercise or reading activity that has not been published yet. Draft activities are only visible for repository owners and course admins and are used to create and test activities before they are published. When you add a new exercise to Dodona, it will automatically be in draft mode until you publish it.

On the home page of Dodona, you can find all your drafts under _Draft exercises_. This gives you an overview of all the activities you are still working on. Once the exercise is ready, you can publish it. To do this, navigate to the activity and click "Publish activity" at the top of the page.

## How do I create new exercises? <Badge type="tip" text="teacher" />
As a teacher, you can use the hundreds of exercises that are available in Dodona, but you can also create new exercises yourself. You can follow [this guide](/en/guides/exercises/creating-exercises/introduction) for this.
