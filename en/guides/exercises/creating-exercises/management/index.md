# Creating Exercises: Next Steps

Now that you have an exercise that can be used on Dodona, there are many additional things you can do.
Here are some suggestions for your next steps:

- [Create a course](/en/guides/teachers/creating-a-course/).
- [Use your exercise in an exercise series within a course](/en/guides/teachers/exercise-series-management/).
- Create [reading activities](/en/guides/exercises/examples/content/) with extra information or small pieces of theory.
- Develop other types of exercises.

Have fun using Dodona!
