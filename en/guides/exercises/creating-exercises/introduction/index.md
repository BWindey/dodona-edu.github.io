# Creating Exercises: Introduction

The barrier to creating exercises for Dodona is not low: besides the time investment, several steps must be completed before the actual creation process can begin.

This guide aims to address that challenge by walking through all the steps from start to finish to create a fully functional exercise.
Once you have created your first exercise, you can use it as a template for developing additional exercises.

Creating your own exercises has several advantages:
You can tailor exercises to your students' interests and the content of their courses.
It is also recommended to use new exercises for tests or exams.

Since this guide covers all the steps in detail, it is primarily intended for teachers with no prior experience in creating exercises for Dodona.
To keep things straightforward, we make the following choices:

- We create a Python-based exercise.
- We use _Visual Studio Code for the Web_ as the text editor. This editor runs in the browser, eliminating the need for additional installation.
- We use the _template repository_ as a starting point for creating an exercise.

This guide consists of several chapters.
You can navigate to the previous or next chapter at the bottom of each page, or you can access all chapters via the sidebar.
