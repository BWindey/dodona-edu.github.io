# Exercise with Functions

In this guide, we will create an exercise that uses functions.

We will design an exercise where students must implement a function that returns the smallest number of the two arguments.
This guide will provide a complete walkthrough for using this exercise in Dodona.

We assume that you already have a working exercise repository.
If that is not the case, please first follow the guide [_Creating Exercises_](/en/guides/exercises/creating-exercises/introduction/).
