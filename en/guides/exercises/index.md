# Creating Exercises

Every instructor can create their own exercises for Dodona.

## Comprehensive Tutorial

If you have never created an exercise for Dodona before, we recommend starting with our [tutorial that explains how to create an exercise from A to Z](/en/guides/exercises/creating-exercises/introduction).

## Types of Exercises

We also have examples of four common types of exercises:

- [Input-Output Exercise](/en/guides/exercises/examples/input-output): an exercise where input is read and a result is output
- [Function Exercise](/en/guides/exercises/examples/function): here, a function must be written that returns a value
- [Class Exercise](/en/guides/exercises/examples/class): here, a class must be written
- [Argument Exercise](/en/guides/exercises/examples/command-line): here, a program must be written that accepts arguments

These tutorials assume that you already have a repository with exercises.
If not, it is best to follow the [comprehensive tutorial](/en/guides/exercises/creating-exercises/introduction) first.

## Test suites

If you are working with the recommended judge, we have the following additional documentation:

- [Test suites for exercises](/en/guides/exercises/testsuites): explanation of the test suites and the different functions that exist.

## Examples

In our [example repository](https://github.com/dodona-edu/example-exercises), you will find various fully developed exercises that can serve as examples.
This repository contains examples for all judges, so choose the appropriate exercises to view.
